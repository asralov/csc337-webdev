      Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, abbreviated as BMW is a German multinational
      manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich,
      Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of
      aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933
      to 1945. Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and
      Rolls-Royce, and motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In
      2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles,
      with 2,279,503 vehicles produced. The company has significant motor-sport
      history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the Isle of Man TT.
      BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany,
      Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United
      Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family is a long-term
      shareholder of the company, following investments by the brothers Herbert
      and Harald Quandt in 1959 that saved BMW from bankruptcy, with the
      remaining shares owned by the public. If you want to get more info,
