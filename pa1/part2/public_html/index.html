        There is a saying in Uzbekistan that guests can only leave their host’s
        house after palov has been offered. Palov is a traditional dish made and
        shared throughout rural and urban communities of Uzbekistan. It is
        prepared with ingredients such as rice, meat, spices and vegetables and
        in addition to be enjoyed as a regular meal, is served as a gesture of
        hospitality, to celebrate special occasions like weddings and new year,
        to help those in need who are underprivileged, or to honour loved ones
        who have passed away. Palov may also feature at events alongside other
        rituals taking place such as prayer and performances of traditional
        music.<br>
